Hello everyone,

I'm aware that this is a shorter post, but I just wanted to announce that I have created a new "knowledge base" website that will house a bunch of informal notes and ideas. I released this website mainly as a less organized place to host some notes and files. However, I will still continue to use this blog for more formal writeups and properly-edited articles. While the website's a little bare right now, I plan to continue writing more technical notes, publish some of my existing notes, and I have some cool ideas planned for the future that I'll anounce later.

Thank you!
